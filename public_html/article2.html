        Arrange-Act-Assert is a great way to structure test cases. It prescribes an order of operations:
      </p>
      <p class="text-justify lead">
        <b>Arrange</b> inputs and targets. Arrange steps should set up the test case. Does the test require any objects or special settings? Does it need to prep a database? Does it need to log into a web app? Handle all of these operations at the start of the test.
      </p>
      <p class="text-justify lead">
        <b>Act</b> on the target behavior. Act steps should cover the main thing to be tested. This could be calling a function or method, calling a REST API, or interacting with a web page. Keep actions focused on the target behavior.
      </p>
      <p class="text-justify lead">
        <b>Assert </b> expected outcomes. Act steps should elicit some sort of response. Assert steps verify the goodness or badness of that response. Sometimes, assertions are as simple as checking numeric or string values. Other times, they may require checking multiple facets of a system. Assertions will ultimately determine if the test passes or fails.

        In this example there is a class Addition which has defined set of code which can perform an addition operation. To test it we have create test_calculation_addition() which is structured in a form of AAA.

        #Arange taking the list of inputs which further passed as a parameters to #Act. #Act will invoke the methods from Addition by creating its object. And at last #Assert we have passed some value if operation doesn’t match with assert value then it will fail the test case and throw exception.

        Testing is a process or steps of an analysing code in order to detect the state of disagreement between actual and required / expected conditions. <br/>
        It’s not a secret that an absolute key to developing quality software is to test your code as you write it. After all, source code of your Python application must be bug-free to function correctly, but all human beings generate bugs at a very high rate when writing code. <br/>
        Testing in Python should be performed starting from the first stages and throughout the whole process of development. Tests are written to detect bugs early in the development of the application when bugs are less frequent and less expensive to fix. However, if unit tests are not designed well, or they are run incorrectly, bugs go through into the production stage. Skipping unit testing in the development process will surely cost your company thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of dollars depending on the scale of the project.
      </p>
      <p class="text-justify lead">
        <b>KEY ADVANTAGES OF PYTHON TESTING ARE:</b><br/><br/>
        <b>Detecting problems early </b>- Unit tests disclose problems early into the development.<br/>
        <b>Mitigating change </b>- Allows the developer to refactor the source code during the testing stage and later on, while still making sure the module works as expected.<br/>
        <b>Simplifying integration </b>- By testing the separate components of an application first and then testing them altogether, integration testing becomes much easier.<br/>
        <b>Source of Documentation </b>- The testing with doctest provides a better insight.<br/>
        Also, tests can be run quickly, easily, and as frequently as the project requires it. They serve as executable documentation for the application, and they also serve as an invaluable reminder of bugs you've fixed in the past. As such, they decrease the development time, thus allow to quickly deliver functional code - and that's really the bottom line.
